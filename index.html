        <li>Currently deserts cover around 20% of the world's land, but they are growing, due to desertification</li>
        <li>Because the desert is so dry, the wind will grind pebbles and sand into dust. Occasionally a big wind storm
          will gather up this dust into a huge storm.</li>
        <li>Only certain types of plants can survive the harsh environment of the desert, because of this the desert has
          very sparse vegetation and plants.</li>
        <li>Desert habitats have been harmed by road building and oil drilling that pollute and disrupt the desert
          habitat</li>
        <li>Many oils and minerals are being taken out of the desert that cannot be replaced, causing more damage to the
          environment.</li>
